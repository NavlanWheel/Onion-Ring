## Onion Ring Modpack


#### Disclaimer

- Onion Ring is an Elden Ring modpack that utilizes Mod Engine 2.[^0]
- Take precautions to avoid being banned.
- Seamless coop mod[^1] is recommended because it uses a save file extension (.c02)[^1] that is different from normal Elden Ring save files (.sl2), helping separate normal and modded gameplay.
- Backup normal save files before modding.
- Do not launch the game via the normal launcher while mods are enabled.
- Do not use mods in normal online play.
- Do not use save files that had mods enabled in online play.
- Restore all relevant files to normal after you are done using mods before returning to normal online play.
- Issues may occur if Elden Ring is installed on a different disk from the main Steam library or if launchmod_eldenring.bat is run as administrator.
- Please read footnote links for a better understanding of the modding process.
